GADE 6112 Final Hand In

Started by creating the base canvas. From there started planning what would be needed and the best order in which it should be done. 
Working with the code in Unity was simpler than in purely windows forms, for one a great deal of tutorials are available.
Secondly having the navigator etc available makes it far more relevant in my mind as to what I am trying to achieve when putting in a certain piece of code etc.
The Astar pathfinding package made the AI and movement far simpler, this was needed instead of a NavMesh as my project is in a 2D space.
Transferring the different units took time, most of which I basically started from scratch. This included the wizard and wizard spawning function, along with the factories for the blue and red teams.
The art is from an opengameart open license artist. These were simple but matched the theme. 
Big challenges were the spawning of units and then destruction and the correct points in time.
The biggest was integrating the Astar AI pathfinding and coordinating that with the gameObjects.
